# RGXQoL

Quality-of-life enhancements for WoW Forever (and Classic Era), derived from Leatrix Plus. Requires `RGX-Framework`.

## Commands

- `/qol` opens the options panel.
- `/rl` reloads the UI.

## Repository Workflow

- The GitLab project under `rgxmods/warcraft` is authoritative. Normal work belongs on task branches and must merge through GitLab merge requests, never directly to the default branch.
- Shared CI is included from `rgxmods/warcraft/RGX-Framework` at `/.gitlab/ci/addon.yml`; validation must pass before publishing to the GitHub mirror.
- The GitHub `RGXMods` repository is downstream distribution, not development authority.
- Keep GitLab and GitHub release tags identical, and use protected GitLab release tags.
- Preserve any existing working Wago connection and ID exactly. Never create a new Wago connection without explicit user direction.
- Publishing integrations prohibited by the shared validation policy are retired and must not be restored.
- The root `README.md` must remain detailed and project-specific. Narrow distribution edits must not replace or truncate installation, features, compatibility, usage, media, or support content.
- Verify relative README assets. Do not overwrite newer compatibility facts with stale monorepo or history text.

## Building With RGX-Framework

- Contract first: build new addon behavior from the declarative `RGXAddon(name, opts)` table using only keys the framework ships today. Read `docs/DECLARATIVE-API.md` in `rgxmods/warcraft/RGX-Framework` before writing code; tier 4 keys are future targets, not runtime features. Use `onInit` and addon-scoped methods only where the shipped declarative surface genuinely cannot express the behavior.
- MCP tool loop: before writing UI, timer, event, aura, or slash code, run the rgx-framework MCP tools in order: `rgx_get_contract` -> `rgx_generate_addon` -> `rgx_validate_addon` -> `rgx_audit_lua`. Compare generated Lua with existing integration, validate the actual opts table, and audit every changed Lua file. Never hand-roll what the framework ships.
- Prefer framework subsystems over raw WoW API: timers and repeating schedules, event registration, slash commands, minimap button, saved-settings database, aura watching, UI controls and dropdowns, colors, fonts, theming, tooltips, and sound. The inherited runtime predates this rule (it predates framework integration and carries its own guarded compatibility helpers); migrate it to framework-managed equivalents deliberately, one subsystem at a time, never in sweeping rewrites.
- Forbidden patterns that fail `rgx_audit_lua` and must not appear in new code: raw `C_Timer`, manual event frames, `SLASH_` globals, unguarded `SetAttribute`, raw aura plumbing, and raw hook reassignment.
- Validation: Lua 5.1 (`luac5.1 -p`) and XML (`xmllint`) must pass through the shared CI include before every MR, and the root README stays nonempty and substantive.
- Dependencies: keep `## RequiredDeps: RGX-Framework` and any `## X-RGX-Framework-MinVersion` accurate against the framework version line, and match the TOC SavedVariables name (`RGXQoLDB`) with the declarative `dbName`.
- Repo facts: this addon targets WoW Forever and Classic Era (`11509,16001`) and exposes `/qol` and `/rl`. The TOC owns the `X.Y.Z` version and load order (`RGXQoL_Locale.lua`, then `RGXQoL.lua`; the options UI is a single settings-integrated page built with `UI:CreateOptionsPanel`). Leatrix Plus attribution lives in `Changelog.txt`; preserve it. Recheck facts in the TOC and README when they change.

## Keeping Interface Versions Current

- Ground truth is the game client's own `.build.info` in the WoW installation root: one pipe-delimited row per installed product; the Product column names the flavor and the Version column gives `major.minor.patch.build`. Read it immediately before changing a TOC or releasing.
- Derive `## Interface:` as `major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch` (verified: `1.60.1` -> `16001`, `1.15.9` -> `11509`, `2.5.6` -> `20506`, `5.5.4` -> `50504`). This addon's TOC carries both flavors as a comma-separated list; WoW Forever is the classic beta product row.
- Online cross-checks for builds not installed locally: the wago.tools build pages and versions.wowtools.io. Verify a feed is reachable at runtime before trusting it; if it is unreachable, the installed client's `.build.info` is authoritative.
- A stale `## Interface:` value is a bug: fix it in a task-branch MR with green shared validation before any release.
- Release through GitLab MR and green shared validation, then patch-bump through the same discipline and create a protected GitLab release tag matching the TOC version. Verify the identical tag on the downstream `RGXMods/RGXQoL` mirror before reporting distribution pickup.
